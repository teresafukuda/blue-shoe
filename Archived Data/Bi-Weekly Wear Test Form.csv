It's important we only wash our clothing when we absolutely need to and reintroduce the habit of using filters into our washing machines. We should all start using Guppyfriends or microfiber (fiber fragment) laundry balls.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Similar to how the cup is the center of the image, people tend to only focus on these larger plastics. But by looking closer at the surrounding area, you can see that there are traces of microplastic everywhere else, all of which are rarely thought about unless brought up.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is comprised of 20,000,000 square kilometers of ocean.  Within this vast part of the ocean, we have a swirling ball of trash and plastic that sea creatures are ingesting daily.  That photo is not even recent (circa 2008).  I can only imagine how much worse it has gotten with a growing population on Earth.  The facts are that this has been an issue for a very long time, and there's evidence of this from at least 11 years ago.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
